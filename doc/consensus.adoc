## Managing system consensus

Newton, like all applications, has differing consistency needs depending on what is being done.

For elements like Saga processing or the `SharedDatasourceView`, you need to ensure that a piece of data will only
be processed once.

Newton implements these verying consistency systems by implementing a consensus system and using it to provide
distributed resource management across the group.

Moving this intelligence to the application tier enables the handling of event semantics much more naturally, and
 allows the use of a far simpler, more generic data tier.

Currently JGroups is used to implement this system, using UDP Multicast, or TCP based gossip locators (where UDP is
not available, eg Docker overlay networks)
