## Event Sourced Aggregate Roots - Transactional Code

In the DDD world, Aggregate Roots are the transactional consistency limit.



### Creating a new Aggregate Root

define the type.
define the events it is made up of.
needs an empty constructor for reply.
adding api methods.
event handlers

state should only be created and altered
from within the event handlers


### Using EventSourceRepository

new instance
load
Optimistic locing
save
replay

### Inspecting the streams

The event source stream, a shallow stream, conceptually bound to the lifetime of the owning aggregate root.
  It will most likely have a relatively small number of events in it.

The aggregated stream over the domain can be found at
XXX. It is a deep stream, conceptually unbounded.
